# User Guide
## Introduction
Geoffrey is the freshest task manager on the block. This simple chat-bot is inspired by the American 90's show The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, which stars Will Smith.

As Will Smith, you are able to tell your butler Geoffrey your task list which includes general to-do's, deadlines, and events. Not only can Geoffrey remember these tasks, he can mark them as done, delete them, and sort them based on your commands.
